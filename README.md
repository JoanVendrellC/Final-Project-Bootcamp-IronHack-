# Cyclists involved in traffic crashes in Catalonia (Spain)

Every year in catalonia more than hundred cyclists is involved in traffic crash and some of them suffer serious health consequences and even die.
So, using my skills as a Data Analytics, I analized in what time (per years, months, weekdays even per hours) there are more accidents against cyclists.
Moreover, I tried to create a model to predict with acceptable accuracy the accidents per weekday and per hour.

That is my final project in the Data Analyst bootcamp but it is also my personal project as cyclist.

## Folders list

1. **Raw data & Jupyter Notebooks.** In this folder you can see the raw data and the jupyter notebooks for cleaning the data. In this case, there are three different jupyter notebook. The first one is a cleaning data with categorized way. The second one is less categorized than the first one. The third is the same than the second one but is changed a little bit for using on Tableau. Finally, there is another file for scraping the secondary dataset (licences).

2. **Cleaned datasets and model predictions.** Firstly, there are the cleaned main dataset, split it in less & more categorized. An the othere hand, there are several models with predictions. The number 01 and 02 is modelling with all data but with a imbalanced target to get predictions. The 03, 04 and 05 are models sorted the all data by "f_bicicletes_implicades = number of cyclists involved" and try to make predictions by hour crash, laborday or weekend and finally by weekday.

3. **Data for Tableau.** There are the csv files (accidents & licences) that were used to create the plots for the presentation. 

4. **Presentation.** There is the powerpoint presentation and the picture of the front page.
